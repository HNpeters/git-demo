      <p>The Queen’s Gambit is a 7 part drama mini-series streaming on Netflix. The series has been created by Scott Frank and Allan Scott and is based on the 1983 book of the same name. The book itself is an intensely dramatic piece of fiction,written by Walter Tevis. The series is set in during the 1960s and portrays a young girl journey of 10 years from being an unknown to finally fulfilling her ambitions. The Queen’s Gambit begins with its protagonist 20 years old, Beth Harmon (Anya Taylor-Joy) in Paris arriving late for a chess game. It looks like an important game of her life, as it is covered by the reporters and audience alike. She arrived disarranged, drugged, and half asleep. The story moves back in time when Beth was 5 years old. In a tragic accident, Beth loses her mom and is soon admitted to a community Orphan. Feeling distinct and isolated, Beth befriends Jolene, her only friend throughout. Days of weary and boredom crept in, when Beth, one day,accidentally came across a board of chess in the basement. Her curiosity heightens when the janitor, Mr. Shaibel (Bill Camp) to whom the board belongs, tells her, “Girls do not play Chess.” Beth, suffering from heightened emotions and anger,gets adamant to learn it. Teenage Beth is adopted by a family, Mrs. Alma Wheatley (Marielle Heller), and her husband, Allston. A new life in Kentucky, and a new routine for Beth, filled with an alcoholic mother and a missing father, away for business trips. Beth finds her solace again in drugs and chess. She starts playing Chess tournaments and soon finds her way up to the ladder. When Beth’s new mother, Mrs. Wheatley finds out that Beth is winning prize money through Chess, shebecomes Beth’s self-assigned agent and they together start slaying the world in the game. Beth becomes a chess prodigy and a heavy substance addict until she finally realizes her dream to become the World Champion.</p>
      <!-- CAST  -->
      <h2 id="character">CAST</h2>
      <p> Anya Taylor is a wicked delight as Harmon, after her spectacular starring turn in the new film version of "Emma", which earned her a second 2020 Golden Globe nomination for best actress for a motion picture comedy or musical. Bill Camp also excelsas Mr. Shaibel, the janitor who teaches Harmon how to play chess in the orphanage. Moses Ingram portrays Jolene, Beth's best childhood friend.There are many other men and women who deliver as a strong cast around Taylor-Joy, but writer and director Marielle Heller stands out acting as Alma, Beth's heavy-drinking but highly supportive adoptive mother. "Harry Potter" movie fans also will recognize Harry Melling, aka Dudley Dursley, who plays Harry Beltik. Another British actorfeatured in "The Queen's Gambit" is Thomas Brodie-Sangster, best known for his younger roles in "Love Actually" and "Game of Thrones. Because the majority of the filming was carried out in Berlin, the minor roles were filled mostly by Britishand German actors.</p>
